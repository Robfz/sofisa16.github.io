The topics to cover are:

DiffMerge

1. Get [DiffMerge] to work with your git toolset.

Branching

2. Work with a partner to fork their repository via [GitHub]. Now you can modify and work with your own copy of that repository. You can fork anything on [GitHub], that is what the community is about!
3. Now since you are working with a partner you can organize to create a pull request so that your modifications on your forked repository go back to her main repository that you forked from.
